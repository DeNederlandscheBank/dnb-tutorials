1. Fork the `dnb-tutorials` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/dnb-tutorials.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv dnb-tutorials

    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
